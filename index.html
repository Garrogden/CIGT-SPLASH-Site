    Welcome to CIT SPLASH. We know that higher education is required to move ahead in todays technology world. IUPUI is an urban campus, working with full-time students fresh out of High School and working adults.  We are willing to work with potential students and current students to award them credits based on prior experience.  We offer competency based evaluations for students to prove they have the skills necessary for the credits in these classes.   We also offer the ability to test out of courses if you feel you have adequate knowledge.
    Since fall 2014, the CIT program has evaluated and awarded credit based on students knowledge 74 times, with 38% of those based on life experience.
    The list of courses that students currently have the ability to receive credit completion on are listed here.
